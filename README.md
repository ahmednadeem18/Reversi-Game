# Reversi

This is a simple Reversi (also known as Othello) game written in C++.

## What is Reversi?

- Reversi is a 2-player strategy board game
- It is played on an 8x8 board with black and white discs
- Players take turns placing a disc on the board
- If you trap your opponentâ€™s discs between two of your own (in a straight line), you flip them to your color
- The game ends when the board is full or no more moves are possible
- The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins

## Features

- Two player mode (play with a friend)  
- Player vs Computer mode

This project is a good way to learn and practice basic C++ and game logic.

Enjoy the game!
